# Portfolio - Version 2


## Why?

Every project has to have a why. In this case, I redesigned my portfolio because the first version was unprofessional, and it does not reflect my skills. Back when I created version 1, I had no work to showcase and I ended up using android themes I created as a placeholder.

It's been almost half a year since then, so my portfolio is long overdue for a proper overhaul. I mean, I still don't have any good projects to showcase, but hopefully I'll get something up soon.

## How?

This project doesn't use any tools that are new to me. I tried to stick to tech I knew, because I wanted to focus on the content and design.

Technologies used include:

* GitHub Pages
* Jekyll
* SASS + Bourbon + Neat

That's pretty much it. Nothing crazy. I do want to talk about how I structured the project, kept it organized, and managed my files. I think that is where I really made a breakthrough in this project. I'll save that for another post though.

## Documenting Version 1

I don't want to forget the visual design of the first edition of my portfolio. In 10 years, I will have gone through many redesigns of my site, and I want to keep track of each iteration so I have something to remember. This was inspired by [DevTips creator Travis showing his old work.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLbUzwxkwHA)
