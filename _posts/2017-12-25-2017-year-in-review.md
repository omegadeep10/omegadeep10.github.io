# 2017 - Year In Review

I haven't written a blog post in...about a year and a half? I started this blog with good intentions; I planned to regularly update it and use it as a public journal. That plan went south very quickly. However, I didn't want to post nothing in 2017, so here is a reflection on my 2017 experience. 

## Major Events

I had a very eventful year. Most importantly, I graduated! I graduated Summa Cum Laude from Middle Georgia State University with a bachelors in IT. My concentration was in Software Development. I was also fortunate enough to be inducted into Alpha Iota Mu (AIM), an honor society for IT students. My participation in the Knight Rider and Capstone Projects also allowed me to wear a cord that signified I participated in MGA's Experiential Learning initiative.

I also accepted a full-time position at Southern Trust, as a Systems Analyst. All I can say is that it's about time! I've been working at Southern Trust for a year and a half now, as a web developer intern. I am looking forward to settling into my new role as a Systems Analyst. It comes with significantly more responsibilities, but I'm looking forward to tackling more complex projects and contributing more.

I moved out. I used to drive from Dublin to Macon and back 3 days a week while I was interning at Southern Trust. I've finally found an apartment in Macon, fairly close to work. My commute time has been cut down from 60 minutes to 5 minutes. Thank god! Of course moving out comes with a different set of challenges, but I'm looking forward to it.

I participated in multiple hackathons. My professor, a fellow student, and I competed in several hackathons located in Atlanta. One was Atlanta's Civic Coding Hackathon, and the other was TAG's IoT GA hackathon. We did not win, but we were finalists at both. At the civic coding hackathon, we made it to top 8 out of 92 finalists! Both hackathons were an amazing experience, and I'm grateful for the opportunity.

## What's next?

So, what's 2018 going to be like for me? What are my new year's resolutions? Frankly, I don't have all the answers yet. I also think 2018 is going to throw a few curveballs at me. Nevertheless, I have a few goals that I want to accomplish in 2018.

* Maintain relationships (and build new ones)
* Write more.
* Grow personally and professionally.
* Live on my own.


### Maintaining and creating relationships

Social interaction and general social skills do not come easily to me. In 2018, I want to maintain the relationships I've created in 2017. I have a bad habit of falling out of touch with people. I also want to meet new people; I'm moving to a new town, so this is a good opportunity for that.

### Writing more

A few friends of mine are very big into writing. They've inspired me to try to write more journals and blog posts, as a way of expressing myself. I think this will be very fulfilling and useful. The hard part of course is sticking with it. In 2018, I want to write at least 1,000 words every week. I think this is a reasonable goal.

### Growing Personally and Professionally

My new position offers me the opportunity to contribute in several major projects that will greatly affect the company. It is also a learning experience that will teach me several different technologies, frameworks, and ideas. I want to make the most of these opportunities and learn as much as I possibly can, both on and off the clock. Outside of work, I want to push myself to get out of my comfort zone and learn those parts of software development that seem scary; I think it's time to dive into more mathematics, algorithms, and read more about best software development practices.

### Living on my own

I've never lived on my own. Theoretically, I am familiar with the skills necessary to "adult" successfully. Skills such as planning and sticking to a budget, cooking, cleaning, basic repairs, planning ahead, scheduling, and a lot more. However, I know from experience that theoretical knowledge is almost worthless. In 2018, I need to apply these skill in real life to succeed on my own.


For me, I think 2017 was a good year. I had many accomplishments, and I grew as a person. There were many failures as well. I failed at updating this blog regularly, I didn't complete as many of my projects at Southern Trust as I hoped, and I feel like I didn't maintain and grow my relationships like I should have. However, 2018 is a clean slate. 2018 represents an opportunity to learn, grow, and improve.

I'm positively looking forward to 2018. I've tried to set the bar high for myself. Let's see what I deliver. Goodbye for now, talk to you in 2018. (Hopefully regularly)
