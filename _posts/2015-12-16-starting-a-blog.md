##But...Why?

It's almost 2016! For my New Year's resolution, I want to start putting my thoughts out there. I honestly don't think anyone will read this blog, but I think blogging is a great idea anyways. Writing also helps me think clearly because the process of putting words on paper forces me to clarify and explain the thoughts inside my head.

For example, whenever I have a programming problem, stepping away from the problem and coming back makes me realize something I was missing. The issue was really the way I was approaching the problem, and collecting and ordering my thoughts through writing helped me get through my brain fog. Blogs are really just a collection of ordered thoughts made public.

###Content

Great, so I've decided to start a blog. I still don't know what I want to write about. I'm interested in many topics: programming, android theming, graphic/web design, reading, and a lot more. This blog will probably reflect those interests. I know I will definitely write about android theming, more specifically, Kustom Live Wallpaper. I'll probably also have some posts on learning JavaScript and making stuff with it. I'll make the rest of it up as I go.

###Schedule

I want to post at least once every week. That will probably not happen since I have work, school, and other responsibilities, but I think I'll write down a few posts in my free time and release them once a week or something. This is a rough plan for the blog, so a lot of this will change over time. We'll see where it goes.
