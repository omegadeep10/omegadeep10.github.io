##Procrastination Sucks.

Procrastination is something I deal with every day. I sit down at my computer and I  think, *okay, I'm going to be productive today and get shit done!*

That obviously doesn't happen. Instead, I find some reason to check my email, browse reddit, or play a game. Recognizing when my brain is trying to subtly make me less productive is a skill I need to learn. Unfortunately for me, this is easier said than done. I often recognize that I'm slacking off and I should be doing real work, but I can't seem to make myself do the work.

I could use apps that block reddit and Facekbook, but that doesn't address the real issue. The real issue is not getting easily distracted. Recognizing what distracts you and learning how to avoid those distractions isn't easy. It will always be easier to slack off  than do productive work.

Honestly, there is no magic answer or technique that will instantly make you more productive. The only way to stop procrastinating is to **recognize** it's going to be hard and accept that.

I do have a couple of tips and tricks that helped me:

* <p class="bold">Make Lists.</p> These are great for getting a birds eye view of what you need to do. I don't bother with fancy list apps because it's a hassle to use them effectively. Get into the habit of jotting things down on a post-it and then think about upgrading to electronic notes.
* <p class="bold">Calendar</p> Use one. This will help you keep track of assignments so that they don't sneak up on you. Something due 3 boxes from today has more presence than something due on the 8th.
* <p class="bold">Set clear goals.</p> Don't say I'll finish this by next week; say I will have this done by 12 AM on Saturday.

I hope this helps. I said I was going to update this blog regularly, and then I totally forgot about that... -_-
