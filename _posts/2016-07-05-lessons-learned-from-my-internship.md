# Lessons Learned From My Internship.

I have been working at [Southern Trust Insurance](http://www.stins.com/) since April. This is a paid internship where I was tasked with updating their website. As you can see from the link above, it is fairly outdated, both in terms of the code base and design. It's been roughly 3 months since I started, and I've learned a lot from working there. In this post, I'll summarize my experience at Southern Trust.

## The Interview.

I first heard about the open internship through my school. At this point, I knew HTML, CSS fairly well, and JavaScript and Python at a beginner level. I had just finished creating a resume as well. I also knew how to use Adobe Illustrator, InDesign, and Photoshop at a basic level.

The job application asked for experience with HTML/CSS, graphic design, and ASP.NET. I had no experience with ASP.NET at the time, but I applied anyways. I received a call from HR after about two weeks, to schedule an interview.

I was very nervous before the interview. Luckily for me, the interview itself was fairly smooth. I met with HR, and two IT employees. We talked about my skills, experience, and what I brought to the table. They were specifically looking for someone with experience with ASP.NET, so I tried to showcase my ability to learn quickly.

I also asked them a few questions about company culture, long-term company goals, etc. to understand the company. I was surprised there were no technical interview questions at all, but I suppose they know applicants for a student internship probably don't have that much knowledge yet.

## First Day Of Work.

So a few weeks after the interview, I was notified that I had the job. I started a week later. On the first day, I was given a tour of the IT department, with a brief overview of how the various systems work, what the IT department is working on, and what I'm supposed to be doing. A lot of this information went over my head, but it really helped me get a big picture view the IT office, and how I fit into that.

I was setup with a computer, and given the task to work on the website. That statement was very broad, and I was given a lot of leeway in how I approached the task. My manager told me what they liked and disliked about the current website and what they wanted to add. Based on this information, I started thinking about how I could create a site to meet those requirements.

I will be adding more to this post later.
