# Lessons Learned From My Internship.

I have been working at [Southern Trust Insurance](http://www.stins.com/) since April. This is a paid internship where I was tasked with updating their website. As you can see from the link above, it is fairly outdated, both in terms of the code base and design. It's been roughly 3 months since I started, and I've learned a lot from working there. In this post, I'll summarize my experience at Southern Trust.

## The Interview.

I first heard about the open internship through my school. The job application asked for experience with HTML/CSS, graphic design, and ASP.NET. I had no experience with ASP.NET at the time, but I applied anyways. I received a call from HR after about two weeks, to schedule an interview.

I was very nervous before the interview. Luckily for me, the interview itself was fairly smooth. I met with HR, and two IT employees. We talked about my skills, experience, and what I brought to the table. They were specifically looking for someone with experience with ASP.NET, so I tried to showcase my ability to learn quickly.

I also asked them a few questions about company culture, long-term company goals, etc. to understand the company. I was surprised there were no technical interview questions, but I suppose they know applicants for a student internship probably don't have that much knowledge yet.

## First Day Of Work.

So a few weeks after the interview, I was notified that I had the job. I started a week later. On the first day, I was given a tour of the IT department, with a brief overview of how the various systems work, what the IT department is working on, and what I'm supposed to be doing. A lot of this information went over my head, but it really helped me get a big picture view the IT office, and how I fit into that.

I was setup with a computer, and given the task to work on the website. That statement was very broad, and I was given a lot of leeway in how I approached the task. My manager told me what they liked and disliked about the current website and what they wanted to add. Based on this information, I started thinking about how I could create a site to meet those requirements. I'll talk specifically about the work I did at Southern Trust in another post.

## Lessons Learned.

Finally, what did I learn during my Internship?

### It's okay not to know everything.

Southern Trust's IT department uses several different systems and tools. It's impossible to learn them all in such a short period of time. Instead, I tried to figure out who I should approach if I needed to know more about a specific system. Establishing a general mental model of how Southern Trust works was also helpful for me, because even if I did not know the specifics, I knew enough to talk to the right person.

### Learn on the job.

I had to use ASP.NET, C# and the MVC design pattern to create a website. I also had to implement an ASP.NET CMS called Umbraco. I had no experience with any of these tools and languages before this job. However, I was able to implement a fully functional website using those tools by googling errors, reading documentation, and watching tutorials.

### Ask questions.

Seriously, just ask. Don't waste time trying to figure it out on your own when there is a good chance a coworker knows the answer. Email is especially great for this.
