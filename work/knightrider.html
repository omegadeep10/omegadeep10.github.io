  I worked closely with another student and my professor to create a prototype application for MGA. Knight Rider allows faculty, staff, and students at MGA
  to organize and share rides with each other from campus to campus. This involved creating a web application, iOS app, and android app that all
  communicate with a Java + Spring powered REST API. I was responsible for the design of the various apps, and responsible for implementing the web application.

    I worked closely with another student and my professor to create a prototype application for MGA. Knight Rider allows faculty, staff, and students at MGA
    to organize and share rides with each other from campus to campus. This involved creating a web application, iOS app, and android app that all
    communicate with a Java + Spring powered REST API. I was responsible for the design of the various apps, and responsible for implementing the web application.
    This application was submitted to two hackathons; it was a finalist at both.

        <p>The home page allows users to view their currently active rides and their completed rides. In addition, each ride card provides important metadata
            concerning each ride, such as time, location, total members, and more. Users may also search for new rides or create rides.

      <p>
        This page uses the Google Maps API and trip location data to provide a visual way to finding rides to join. Clicking on any of the trip cards in the
        sidebar or in the map view itself will show the trip detail view for that ride.

        The trip detailed view shows the user all the important and relevant information about the trip on one page. It also allows the user to leave or join
        the trip, and communicate with other trip participants and the driver using the built-in chat functionality.
