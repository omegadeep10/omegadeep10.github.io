  <h1>Unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe</h1>
  <p>I created a simple tic-tac-toe game in Python. The game features a basic artificial intelligence player. This ai makes the best move possible given a specific board state. It does this by recursively analyzing the win potential of every possible move that can be made, using a minimax algorithm.</p>
