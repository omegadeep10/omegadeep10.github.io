  <h1>SWORDS Redesign</h1>
  <p>SWORDS is a course registration system used by my school. I led a team in redesigning the interface to facilitate ease-of-use and understandability, especially for the non-technically inclined users. We conducted an usability analysis, designed mockups, and created prototypes.</p>

    <h2>The Login Page</h2>
    <p>We optimized the login page for simplicity. Our participants had difficulty understanding how to log in, so we made the instructions (and help information) hard to miss.</p>

    <h2>The Dashboard</h2>
    <p>We redesigned the home page of SWORDS as a dashboard interface. This is to allow users to jump to any specific section of SWORDs instantly, without having to click through several menus or different pages. It also gives users a "birds-eye" view of SWORDS, which helps prevent confusion.</p>

    <h2>The Registration Page</h2>
    <p>A major section of SWORDS that users had difficulty using is the registration page. We used tables to display classes in an efficient, understandable format. A full explanation of this screen can be found in the paper linked below.</p>

    <h2>Class Details Modal</h2>
    <p>We discovered that users want to see detailed class information without having to navigate to a different page. To facilitate this, we integrated a modal directly into the registration page.</p>
