                <h3>Minimal & Music Centered</h3>
                <p>I designed this theme specifically for music lovers. It features easy access to music controls right from the home screen and a beautiful background that dynamically changes based on the currently playing song's album art.</p>
                <h3>Distraction Free</h3>
                <p>Despite the minimal music centered look, this theme doesn't neglect the important features. Swiping left or right reveals a clean app launcher and the current time, date, and battery level.</p>

                <h3>Powered by Kustom</h3>
                <p>The entire theme was designed and created with Kustom, which allowed me to pull and use media information on the home screen. Kustom also allowed me to animate the CD and add transitions when scrolling to a different page. It also features 2 alternate layouts for the music controls that can be enabled by toggling global variables.</p>

                <h3>Alternate Controls</h3>
                <p>The theme also features 3 different types of controls: No controls, controls at the bottom, and controls on the side. These can be toggled simply by toggling a few Kustom variables.</p>
