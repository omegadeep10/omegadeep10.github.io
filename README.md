# omegadeep10.github.io
omegadeep10's website with blog posts, articles, news, portfolio, contact information and more.

Future Reference because I will forget why/how I set this up:

- Don't use the posts folder. Remember, I don't need dates on anything because it shows how infrequently I update the blog.
- All "posts" go under the articles folder. Each post uses it's
own layout and design. The posts' accompanying css file can be found
in /css/articles. This means if you update your portfolio later, your
posts can just be copy/pasted over.
- Any assets required by the article are stored in /assets/articles.
- Using normalize.sass, bourbon, and neat. Keep it updated I suppose.
- Each work page has a yaml front-matter: title & description. This is used in that page's meta tags for SEO.
